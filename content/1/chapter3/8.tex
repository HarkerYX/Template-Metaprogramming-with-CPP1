In this chapter, we have explored an important category of templates, variadic templates, which are templates with a variable number of template arguments. We can create variadic function templates, class templates, variable templates, and alias templates. The techniques to create variadic function templates and variadic class templates are different but incur a form of compile-time recursion. For the latter, this is done with template specialization, while for the former with function overloads. Fold expressions help to expand a variable number of arguments into a single expression, avoiding the need of using function overloads and enabling the creation of some categories of variadic variable templates such as the ones we have previously seen.

In the next chapter, we will look into a series of more advanced features that will help you consolidate your knowledge of templates.
