A variadic template is a template with a variable number of arguments. This is a feature that was introduced in C++11. It combines generic code with functions with variable numbers of arguments, a feature that was inherited from the C language. Although the syntax and some details could be seen as cumbersome, variadic templates help us write function templates with a variable number of arguments or class templates with a variable number of data members in a way that was not possible before with compile time evaluation and type safety.

In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Understanding the need for variadic templates

\item
Variadic function templates

\item
Parameter packs

\item
Variadic class templates

\item
Fold expressions

\item
Variadic alias templates

\item
Variadic variable templates
\end{itemize}

By the end of the chapter, you will have a good understanding of how to write variadic templates and how they work.

We will start, however, by trying to understand why templates with variable numbers of arguments are helpful.
