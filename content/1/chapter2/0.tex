In the previous chapter, we saw a short introduction to templates. What they are, how they are helpful, pros and cons for using templates, and, also, a few examples of function and class templates. In this chapter, we will explore this area in detail, and look at aspects such as template parameters, instantiation, specializations, aliases, and more. The main topics that you will learn about from this chapter are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
How to define function templates, class templates, variable templates, and alias templates

\item
What kinds of template parameters exist?

\item
What is template instantiation?

\item
What is template specialization?

\item
How to use generic lambdas and lambda templates
\end{itemize}

By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with the core fundamentals of templates in C++ and be able to understand large areas of template code and also write templates by yourself.

To start this chapter, we will explore the details of defining and using function templates.
