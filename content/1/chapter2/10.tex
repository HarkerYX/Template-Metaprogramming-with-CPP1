This chapter was a walk through of the core features of C++ templates. We have learned how to define class templates, function templates, variable templates, and alias templates. Along the way, we looked in detail at template instantiation and template specialization after learning about template parameters. We also learned about generic lambdas and lambda templates and what benefits they have compared to regular lambdas. By completing this chapter, you are now familiar with the template fundamentals, which should allow you to understand large parts of template code as well as write templates yourself.

In the next chapter, we will look at another important topic, which is templates with a variable number of arguments called variadic templates.
