This chapter introduced the concept of templates in the C++ programming language.

We started by learning about the problems for which the solution is the use of templates. We then saw how templates look with simple examples of function templates, class templates, and variable templates. We introduced the basic terminology for templates, which we will discuss more in the forthcoming chapters. Toward the end of the chapter, we saw a brief history of templates in the C++ programming language. We ended the chapter with a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using templates. All these topics will lead us to understand the next chapters better.

In the next chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of templates in C++.
