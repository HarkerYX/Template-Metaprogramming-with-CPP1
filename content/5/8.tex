\textbf{Question 1}

What are the sequence containers from the standard library?

\hspace*{\fill} \\ %插入空行
\noindent
\textbf{Answer}

The sequence containers from the C++ standard library are std::vector, std::deque, std::list, std::array, and std::forward\_list.

\textbf{Question 2}

What are the common member functions defined in the standard containers?

\hspace*{\fill} \\ %插入空行
\noindent
\textbf{Answer}

The member functions that are defined for most containers in the standard library are size (not present in std::forward\_list), empty, clear (not present in std::array, std::stack, std::queue, and std::priority\_queue), swap, begin, and end.

\textbf{Question 3}

What are iterators and how many categories exist?

\hspace*{\fill} \\ %插入空行
\noindent
\textbf{Answer}

An iterator is an abstraction that enables us to access the elements of a container in a generic way, without having to know the implementation details of each container. Iterators are key for writing general-purpose algorithms. There are six categories of iterators in C++: input, forward, bidirectional, random-access, contiguous (as of C++17), and output.

\textbf{Question 4}

What operations does a random-access iterator support?

\hspace*{\fill} \\ %插入空行
\noindent
\textbf{Answer}

The random-access iterators must support the following operations (in addition to those required for input, forward, and bidirectional iterators): the + and - arithmetic operators, inequality comparison (with other iterators), compound assignment, and offset dereference operators.

\textbf{Question 5}

What are range access functions?

\hspace*{\fill} \\ %插入空行
\noindent
\textbf{Answer}

Range access functions are non-member functions that provide a uniform way to access the data or properties of containers, arrays, and the std::initializer\_list class. These functions include std::size/std::ssize, std::empty, std::data, std::begin, and std::end.
