In the previous chapters, we learned the core fundamentals of C++ templates. At this point, you should be able to write templates that are perhaps not very complex. However, there are many more details concerning templates, and this chapter is dedicated to these more advanced topics. These include the following topics that we address next:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Understanding name binding and dependent names

\item
Exploring template recursion

\item
Understanding template argument deduction

\item
Learning forwarding references and perfect forwarding

\item
Using the decltype specifier and the std::declval type operator

\item
Understanding friendship in templates
\end{itemize}

On completing this chapter, you will acquire a deeper knowledge of these advanced template concepts and be able to understand and write more complex template code.

We will start this chapter by learning about name binding and dependent names.
