In this final chapter of the book, we explored the C++20 ranges library. We started the discussion with a transition from the abstract concept of a range to the new ranges library. We learned about the content of this library and how it can help us write simpler code. We focused the discussion on range adapters but also looked at constrained algorithms. At the end of the chapter, we learned how to write a custom range adaptor that can be used in combination with standard adapters.
