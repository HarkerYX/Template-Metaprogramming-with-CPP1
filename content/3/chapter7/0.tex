The previous parts of the book were designed to help you learn everything about templates, from the basics to the most advanced features, including the latest concepts and constraints from C++20. Now, it is time for us to put this knowledge to work and learn about various metaprogramming techniques. In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Dynamic versus static polymorphism

\item
The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)

\item
Mixins

\item
Type erasure

\item
Tag dispatching

\item
Expression templates

\item
Typelists
\end{itemize}

By the end of the chapter, you will have a good understanding of various multiprogramming techniques that will help you solve a variety of problems.

Letâ€™s start the chapter by discussing the two forms of polymorphism: dynamic and static.
